# [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016)

The goal of the project is to improve my Java functinal programming skills by solving riddles provided on [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016) in a pure Java8 functional programming way ([Stream API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html#package.description) only, no 3rd party functional libraries like an awsome [JavaSlang](http://www.javaslang.io) for examle).
